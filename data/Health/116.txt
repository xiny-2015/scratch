Xinhua news agency, London on 7 May, (reporter Ge Qiufang) scientists of the University of London in England found that, the human immune system in a protein will accelerate the spread of the AIDS virus (HIV).
According to the latest edition of "New Scientist" magazine, University of London Greg Troels led team found in the study of HIV-1 virus, the virus in the attack humans and monkeys cells in the body, two body called CyclophilinA immune system protein will make the virus occurred deformation, but the attack ability of the virus to humans and after deformation the monkey is very different from the.
The researchers first HIV-1 virus injected into monkeys, deformation results due to the TRIM5alpha monkey virus proteins in the innate immune system is more likely to kill virus. Test and then of the human body is quite different, although the cyclophilin A protein in human immune system will change the HIV 1 virus appearance, can this deformation will make the virus more contagious.
The researchers believe that the HIV-1 virus in attack human cells, will CyclophilinA protein as helping yourself copy tool. HIV-1 virus probably already has the ability to infect human cells across species boundaries before spreading to humans.
Troels said that this discovery makes them towards the understanding of mechanism of human immune system and how the AIDS virus jointly run a step forward, help to find new ways for the treatment of aids.
