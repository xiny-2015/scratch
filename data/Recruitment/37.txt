    Ballet dancers
    The man said: is behind female temperament, rigorous training them, and their capacity to endure pain and manipulation of the body, make the person produces illusion. Their bodies are thin and soft, so in close should be more "exciting".
    Reverie: the location is near the theatre, I drink coffee, a tall and thin girl in the distance. The expression on her face, as if to tell me something. I stepped forward to strike up a conversation with her, due to appreciate each other's emotions, she took me to visit the theater background. That made the background board, oozing with chlorine taste of talcum powder, and occasionally a two walking up and down the little mouse. We entered the dance practice room so big, in the mirror, you can see my two double steps in practice.
    Comment: the argument is quite clear. But we can give people so casual about these dancers was the impression is a bit surprised.
