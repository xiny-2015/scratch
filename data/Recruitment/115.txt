    The more scarce something, its value is high, this is a common sense, and the degree of scarcity of goods both and demand, and supply of, so is the development of the talent market. With the rise of the emerging industry of new and high technology, the international trade barriers, the disappearance of domestic and foreign factors in each industry, the larger changes in the demand for talent, the standard measure of talent also changed, resulting in some popular professional scarce.
    General manager, Shanghai sunward career consulting limited company chief occupation planner Hong Xiangyang (Dale Hong) president pointed out that, according to recent of the company more than 2000 occupation consulting case information database of the results of the analysis, combined with the basic pattern formation of our country's industrial system, the goal of adjusting the industrial structure, think the analysis of information and other aspects of the relevant personnel, 2005 the following 10 kinds of the shortage of professional personnel: 1) trade circulation type 2), information industry, finance and insurance, 3) 4) of automobile and manufacturing complete sets of equipment, 5 class, 6 class) real estate) of modern biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, new materials industry class 7) class, 8), urban agriculture class 9) steel petroleum chemical class, class 10) tourism.

    Analysis of 2005 professional status
    In 2005, the field of economy and talents our country do appear a lot of new imagination, commerce and trade circulation, such as logistics management, marketing major, continuous functions that is worthy of attention. Released in October 20, 2005 third quarter 2005 Beijing City talent market supply and demand information display, the largest number of professionals, marketing ranks first. Hong Xiangyang teacher said, the retail industry, is one of the highlights of this year, WAL-MART, Carrefour, Metro, 7-11, lotus, Auchan, RT mart, Hymall, Haoyouduo, these foreign brands have entered the China market, fierce competition in the industry, from senior management to the general manager of talent demand reached almost crazy degree.
    While the information industry, such as communication engineering, computer software, computer application profession also has professional talent shortage. Telecom value added, this is a very fast development and content rich industry, customized ringing tone, IVR, game, mobile phone text messages (SMS/MMS), the emerging service telephone payment, mobile QQ, a see things in a blur of be just unfolding, the entire industry for talent, especially in the development of talent needs to be like hunger and thirst to. The technology of software talent gap up to 420000 people, the software outsourcing industry, in 2004 into a frenzied expansion stage, to master the software project of Japanese manager are scarce, it has also become a big head hunting company for difficult search target.
    Finance and insurance, such as international accounting professional, professional investment economy, insurance specialty is also worth mentioning, this year the financial and insurance industries won considerable development, in March, Sino US MetLife Insurance Company was established as a symbol of event insurance industry competition intensified, the domestic insurance industry policy to further open up, each big overseas enterprises look at fiercely as a tiger does Chinese this huge market, at the same time, the domestic to the end of the year have been established 14 insurance companies. But talent throughout the financial and insurance industry is not mature, uneven, some good and some bad phenomenon highlights. A senior position in insurance industry needs headhunters hunt is the main professional personnel, senior management personnel, actuaries, and financial sector need financial management and other high-end talent.
    One of the cars and complete sets of equipment manufacturing, such as automobile and tractor specialty, automatic control specialty, physical electronic technology professional personnel also need analysis, the third quarter of 2005 part of city labor market supply and demand situation display, manufacturing requirements of the number is in 1052511 people, accounting for 24.7% of the number of total demand, but at present our country senior technicians account for only the mechanic total 4%, a far cry from the developed countries and as high as a proportion of 30%-40%, senior skilled worker shortage.
    In the real estate industry, such as real estate professional management, construction and real estate industry chaos, the frequent flow of talent is very scarce, but really rich experience can take charge as chief of the project manager. Modern biological, urban agriculture and medicine industry categories, such as biological engineering, pharmaceutical chemistry, landscape architecture specialty, the agricultural economy is emerging popular professional occupation. The new materials industry categories, such as demand composite, polymer materials professional professional personnel reduction. Steel petrochemical, such as materials science and engineering; chemical technology and computer application of composite professional; tourism category, such as tourism management professionals still have the market.
    Why talent in short supply?
    "This year these professional talent supply is more complex, there are historical factors, but also social factors" in domestic and international, Hong Xiangyang teacher said, China market economy and overall national strength increase, gave birth to some special industry talent demand, such as shipping, aviation, new material technology and other high-tech talent demand. A few years ago, due to the cultivation of the consciousness of traditional blue collar workers do not pay enough attention, resulting in a lack of workers in the high-end technology today in the second industry, senior technicians will continue to be popular in the future for a period of time.
    Tilt the domestic central policy, will be the direction of the rise and fall of some industries, the domestic macro-control, by 2005 the central economic conference spirit, clearly put forward 5 key investment in central government determined national key investment direction, we can see that the future of environmental protection, ecology, energy talents demand will be popular the market. The second is the change in the domestic market, the residents' consumption structure upgrading, industrialization, urbanization, marketization, internationalization degree improve, not a positive factor supporting the economy of our country has entered a new round of rising cycle changes, the driving force of economic growth is still strong. From the hot commodity sales prospects, next year housing, automobile, electronic communication, tourism consumption will continue to maintain rapid growth. The existence and changes in these market factors, decided to consumption areas of talent demand, such as the demand for high-end real estate professionals, Wang Sheng tourism talents.
    International factors, from an investment perspective, with the further deepening of the reform of investment and financing system, independent investment of private economic activity will be further enhanced, with foreign enterprises to China economic prospects remain good, investment enthusiasm remains high. Therefore, foreign and private enterprises on the international background of large high-end quality talents demand will still larger, such as the understanding of the international market rules of the occupation manager, familiar with international law talent, grasp the international high-end technology etc..
    The development trend of future trend
    These professionals future development trend, according to the survey can be sharp occupation adviser on Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai 3 different industries, the average monthly income in 5000 - 15000 yuan between those with high income, the salary to occupation managers as an example, the average annual salary of managers in Shanghai 46496 yuan, the average annual salary of managers in Beijing 43496 yuan, the average annual salary of managers in Guangzhou 38496 yuan. The developed city pillar industries including advanced manufacturing and modern service industry, the industry gathered a large number of outstanding management and high-tech talent, large number of paid managers, effectively pulling the entire city manager salary.
    For these people the future trend of development, road IT personnel Xiangyang chief occupation career planner Hong Xiangyang teacher with some work experience in the IT industry as an example, suggested the transition to IT trainer, also can be the transition to IT marketing, IT industry because of the highly technical, marketing personnel generally must have a strong technical background, and have the best rich experience, the Internet, e-commerce, software company now needs to have the technical background of the marketing personnel; in addition, the electronic commerce again unpopular, the traditional enterprises begin to attach importance to e-commerce marketing, also need to have the technical background of the marketing personnel, this kind of work salary is not low, with a percentage should be able to get a higher salary is relatively stable. Third, efforts to project management, the project software manager annual salary of about 100000 yuan.
    Enlightenment cannot miss
    From the above analysis, can not help reminiscent of the talent market is the familiar scene, on the one hand is the talent market crowded, many master doctor could not find satisfying work, expected salary decline; on the other hand tight in urgent need of professional talents to join, spend lots of money to appoint to the task, the headhunter multi out. The workplace personnel to become law soundless and stirless, but firmly and orderly chaos.
    Hong said the teacher, the emergence of the phenomenon of talent supply is in line with the objective law, in line with China benign economic development and China and world economy are inseparable, but human market supply and demand situation has a private market supply and demand changes. In the future development of these emerging industries such as telecommunications, finance and insurance industry, electronic commerce, Internet game industry, construction and real estate, automobile industry, for high-end talent competition will be more intense. Need to have personal qualities, education background, work experience, language (Language) ability, ability of continuous learning and international vision, have a strong desire for success, on the spiritual level, has the high sense of responsibility (social, family), sense of mission personnel.
    But from a personal perspective, people should not just blindly follow the trend, should early personal occupation career planning, starting from the individual interest, ability, combining with the social development of the industry trends to determine their own direction of development. Economist Sheng Hongceng said that "the choice of occupation, not with their own particular ability and others, is the most important and their ratio, find a has the ability of" relative advantage, for us personally, need to do is, to determine their own specialty, and clear the overall trend of the development of the industry, and to set an example by personally taking part.
