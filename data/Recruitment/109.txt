    Case:

Two years have candidates to 5 companies, but every time the final outcome is with the boss or colleagues had a falling out, and finally had to leave the original company. What is the reason for Miss Chen?
    In fact, in the life be leisurely and carefree formed her provide for oneself and live comfortably, security and well-being of the family brings gradually extended to a comfortable. Once entered the competition more intense work environment, the original sense of stability all gone on the job. At the same time, from the life of provide for oneself and live comfortably caused her character wayward and spoiled, and others not a word will turn my face. Under normal circumstances, a lot of people personality even if life is very strong, but in the work will also have convergence. And Miss Chen at work or consistently "Miss" temperament and style, the trouble is.
    Miss Chen is the body of the "wrong" is a lot of people have in common: ease to a certain extent, self-centered, not good conversion work mentality, laziness, lack of sense of responsibility. Therefore, work pressure of competition led directly to the cause of the immovable, more can not be entrusted with the boss thinks highly of reuse. Such as can reasonably regulate themselves, and gradually adapt to the working pressure, the comforts of life into decompression power, work it is necessary to clarify the purpose of their own, to a certain extent to break through the bottleneck of the original work.
