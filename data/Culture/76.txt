&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Jonathan Spence: respected historian Sima Qian
- recently, Shanghai far east press launched America historiography master Jonathan Spence (Jonathan D.Spence) "China Research Series", quite have repercussions in academic and market. You are the series mastermind, and have had the contact with Jonathan Spence, to talk about the impression of him?
- first met Jonathan Spence in the early autumn of 1998. I was fresh out of USA travel back, he went to Shanghai to attend a conference. Remember Shangri-La hotel in Pudong, and his wife lady Jin Anping is here. The history of lady from Taiwan, graduated from the doctor of the Columbia University East Asian Institute, gentle and quiet.
Tall Jonathan Spence was quite different: gray hair on the temples style is already balding and slightly, but still bushy beard; back slightly arched, checkered shirt open at the neck, appear very random but very decent, appears graceful bearing. In the story, the tone of his voice steady but the rhythm is not slow, if it is thought that the focus must be stressed, he will repeat, plus some action range is not small gesture; listen, he looked serious and focused, if feel do not understand or not clear place, he would ask as translation history repeats or Mrs. to explain; speculative place, he will laugh. Looking at his laugh and those slightly exaggerated gestures, come then my mind is Mr. Ma Min have been introduced also by many people pass from mouth to mouth with approbation he opened China history class at Yale: Shengjing hundreds of students crowded with a large classrooms (latecomers aisle, climb windowsill), Professor of the history of mouth when British accent english to "humorous tone, vivid expressions, fiery passion" perform type teaching. With the familiar like flow out of the age, character, place names, events, is after he cut, laying out the story of the historical data, is readily came to poetry, prose or fiction, such as calendar is a the slide and video. No wonder those who rob seat of the students, who will be not in such teaching them about the Far Eastern country first, is the deepest impression? It was at that meeting, I rather take the liberty to his confirmation of his Chinese name was meant to be -- at the time because there are two kinds of view -- Is it right? Out of admiration for Sima Qian, and his real name Spence the first word with "history" homophonic of it? He affirmed, and asked how I think this name, revealed in a triumphant smile. In the literary means to tell the history of two thousand years, Jonathan Spence, is China the true spirit of Han Dynasty historian.
Jonathan Spence in America Sinology circle how to share the status, compared with several other Sinology master, what is his special place?
- I was to introduce his copyright as an example. When I talk to him, hope to publish his all works in the mainland Chinese version, he very readily agreed.
As a work has been in the western academia and the public mind firmly established as a historian, did not hope that the research in his works of the country was warmly welcomed by real? But his frank, I think beyond such desires, and there are about two reasons: the first is before we have had several months of communication, he is recognized on some version of the introduction of academic monographs quality we did; at the same time also disapprove of China published in international copyright convention before several of his works of this translation. Second reasons to say funny, but he is determined to perhaps more important -- he knew me back to Fei Zhengqing of Harvard University director of the center for East Asian Studies from Kong Feili (PhilipA.Kuhn) USA professor "soul stealer: 1768 Chinese hex panic" translation, is a hand editing. "Soul stealer" because the "Levinson best writings China Research Award", the impact of International Sinology is huge, very high status. He seems to be carelessly ask me, this book can sell how much in Chinese. I answered the first print run of fifteen thousand copies should not have what problem (in fact this book in 1999 when the first edition, first impressions are twenty-five thousand copies). I remember clearly that he listened to my answer after that doping is surprised, confused and somewhat excited expression, then and I discussed the translation problems on his work to.
Jonathan Spence, hole Feili and California University of Berkeley's Wakeman (F.JWakeman) is recognized as the best three of the China modern history master; used for the evaluation of East China Normal University professor Zhu Zhenghui hole research ", profound theory, analysis of fine", "Wei characteristic is grand and magnificent, macro insight", but history has "explain profound theories in simple language, interest and knowledge of the characteristics of the combination of". It is precisely because of such characteristics study of the history, and he rarely write in the strict sense of academic papers, doesn't love to attend large-scale academic conference, he is regarded as the "wild west" in USA historiography. "Wild ways" and ranked the chairman of committee of Harvard University in East Asian Studies and is a fellow of USA Art Academy of the humanities Kong Feili naturally a little "neighbors, silos" flavor, but secretly rivalry, compete is absolutely unavoidable. This "Scholars scorn each other." is of course, promote the academic progress. It must also be mentioned.
