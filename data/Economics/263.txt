Since this year, the non beautiful currency against the dollar continued to rise to the euro as a representative of the recent upward trend, especially the swift and fierce not surprised some people. "Five one" holiday just passed, the euro against the dollar has risen to 1.2785. If from last year the lowest point in November 15th 1.1639 date, in the nearly 6 months exchange rate rose a cumulative 1146 basis points, an increase of 9.85%.
The author had published "Euro 2005" farewell luck year (see our seventh edition December 29, 2005). Controls, for half a year, prices of basic consistent with expectations. Gratified, the author also to slightly change occurred at present the market add new.
According to the analysis, the euro dollar exchange rate will rise to three wave structure shape, the first goal should be in 1.2400, the median of 1.2650 targets, the highest goal 1.2890. From this year the actual trend, January 24th high of 1.2322 basic approaches the first goal, after a substantial adjustment after the rise again, to the highest point of the Monday the 1.2785, very close to the 1.2890 target expected.
Since this year, the basic state is the emergence of new trends. Geopolitical factors attention once again, many countries began to reserves in dollars partial adjustment such as the euro, which may have a certain impact on the exchange rate, but had little effect on the collation of view.
June will be the EU summit this year, will again discuss the euro fell sharply once caused the "EU constitution" in the last year. If has not obtained the talks progressed, the implementation will directly affect the bill in November 1st, could trigger a reversal occurred in June the exchange rate.
On the one hand, still do not see signs of "EU constitution" to achieve substantive progress; on the other hand, in June the European Central Bank will raise interest rates again expectation is for market approval. Now just imagine, the market has a June rate rise fully up, then may also appear profit situation real interest rate hike. This may also be an indirect reason the euro reversed.
Of course, the fundamentals of all is a double-edged sword, if the "EU constitution" is passed, then the euro to the last new step is not impossible. From the euro zone fundamentals recent view, the market for European central bank interest rate hike is still optimistic about the prospects, so short-term even if the exchange rate falls, also belongs to the technical adjustment, may once again strong still after the adjustment.
Since this year, the euro / dollar as expected from the beginning of 1.1639 with ABC three wave structure in the uplink, the last outlook cannot confirm is b wave of the callback rate and time. Since the end of 1.2322 slightly lower than expected a wave, C wave starting at 1.1825, if 1.618 times of C waves rise of a wave, target should be 1.2930, this price coincided with the 2004 February high of 1.2927 basic coincidence.
If you can not break through the high, from the long-term trend patterns of view, the euro / dollar and form a big shoulder top will be. Of course, the original analysis mentioned in 1.2890 as the 1.3666-1.1639 of the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement now still can not be ignored. There is the formation of mid top may be in the region of 1.2890-1.2930 exchange. But in the short term, although the exchange rate hit 1.2785 Monday after a slight decline, but still can be considered short-term technical adjustment continuous rise after.
In general, like this year especially unilateral since mid April prices rise, even to reverse appear in a certain area, there will be corresponding with the reversal pattern on the daily chart, V invert simple relatively rare. Therefore, in the current price, although 1.2890-1.2930 has peaked in May (hypothetically), but in the operation should still to moving operation more safe. If the callback rate, short-term can be in 1.2620 and 1.2580 near the small amount of Jiancang, target 1.2880, breaking 1.2550 temporarily stop.
