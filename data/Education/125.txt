Researchers in Italy announced the results show, the emotion is implemented by the chemicals in the brain function.
The study was funded by the Rome Academy of Neurology, psychobiology and psychopharmacology studies a team to mice as object of. When the researchers will be separated from the experimental murine and rats in normal rats, the brain opioid receptors acted anxious, repeatedly emit a cry, as the body is pain suffering like. But when a painkiller researchers to rats fed can act on opioid receptors found, these rats gradually quiet down, and stopped calling. The researchers found that, no opioid receptor in brain of pups no dependence on the mother or craving maternal behavior.
In this regard, America health research Thomas Insel behavior neurologists in "science" magazine a commentary in a subsequent wrote: "separation of painful emotional like physical pain, is a chemical substance through the brain in the same regulation." Conversely, nestled in her mother's side have the kind of comfortable feeling and their mother attachment from the chemical in the brain in the same regulation system.
The expert says, the test may bring inspiration for autism research. Through further research scientists will try to identify, whether those autistic children because of the opioid receptor system interference and the emergence of self sealing behavior, so can not create more intimate contact with the mother and others.
