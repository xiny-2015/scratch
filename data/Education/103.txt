The first article enumerates bacteria, grape, strawberry is how to breed, which in the reader's knowledge is to understand, with the help of the accumulation of knowledge, we understand the asexual reproduction, as bacteria, strawberry, grape breeding, is cloning. Comparison of the second segment and sexual reproduction again explain sexual reproduction and asexual reproduction, as we know, the two time the accumulation of knowledge, so that we get information accurately, cloning is asexual reproduction. We read the cloned sheep is asexual reproduction, which is a process of information reading. We therefore when reading, one is based on the transfers own knowledge accumulation, on the other hand, the need to accurately retrieve fresh information in the article. Accurately obtaining fresh information, one is the need to grasp the overall train of thought of the article, the article points are extracted, in addition to pay attention to exactly two words.
