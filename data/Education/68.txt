Professor Zhang Weiying gave a speech in 2006 China macroeconomic and Reform Trend Forum recently said: I want to emphasize that the tuition fee, I used to say a words also scolded much a word, "why the poor can not afford to go to university, because the tuition is too low". What do you mean? World Bank study, study of Europe were found, we actually use subsidies low fees is rich, not poor supply. Then we put the tuition to appropriately increase, then the provisions of tuition fee number ratio must be used for grants, these problems can be solved very well. Like Peking University, a university student 25000 yuan cost, the government to grant 6000 yuan, 5000 yuan for tuition, other money which come of?
His comments will also get to disorderly brick countless, but I think that, in theory, he said was right. Hand in tuition, a hand paid tuition and living expenses to the children of the poor, is the world famous university practice, is also a first-class university is able to become one of the important system guarantee the first-class university. However, in the actual process, mainland China's colleges and universities do not practice this theory, college only money but not one of the main attention placed on scholarships, grants, not to mention the scholarship as a means to attract outstanding students. On the contrary, we see a lot of schools do not even for the student loan guarantees, there are some schools not to send graduation card threat, requirements students before graduation owing on the loan or owed fees.
In contrast, in half a month ago in Beijing organized by the merit Advisory Committee, University of Hong Kong, Chinese University Hong Kong, Hong Kong Polytech University, City University Hong Kong and other colleges and universities in Hongkong have few with generous scholarships to attract outstanding students from the mainland. Among them, Chinese University Hong Kong this year by matriculate way in Beijing to recruit 28 people, 7 people will be able to enjoy the full scholarship of HK $500000. Four years of university tuition fees, and even life, are still more than sufficient. Hong Kong University Science &amp; Technology last year to recruit 170 mainland students, they received a total of more than about 16000000 yuan of the total scholarship. University of Hong Kong this year said, 20 provinces and cities in the country to recruit 250 to 300 students, provide a $13000000 scholarship. The next three years, University of Hong Kong offers 55000000 yuan entrance scholarships for outstanding students to the world. Among the many famous universities in foreign countries, the most intense competition is increasingly manifested as to see who the scholarship more lucrative, wider coverage.
But how the domestic university? Take Peking University as an example, the 2004-2005 academic year scholarship total nearly 7550000 yuan. Among them, the off campus donated scholarship amount is 5850000 yuan, the total investment of nearly 1700000 yuan scholarship school; and each student have only one chance of winning, single scholarship, the maximum amount of 12000 yuan. But the Peking University existing in junior college students more than 9000 people, master 4500 people or so, doctoral students about 1600 people, foreign students from 66 countries over 1000. The light of college students a year tuition income amounted to HK yuan, scholarship it out only accounts for less than 3.8% of the students pay tuition!
And every year whether the funds as Professor Zhang said an average of only 6000 yuan? I see in new network such a message: China News Agency, Taipei, 2005 December 16, Peking University President Xu Zhihong led the Peking University delegation of more than 50 people visit in Taipei Ross Fu Lu of National Taiwan University, and was invited to the NTU speech published in plants. Xu Zhihong and National Taiwan University President Li Sicen on the cross strait higher education funding exchange of views. Li Sicen said, if not special funds each year, National Taiwan University funds converted into RMB about 2800000000 yuan, Peking University each year about 2000000000 yuan of funds.
In the 985 project was proposed, the central government in the late ninety's special funds allocated to the Peking University in 1800000000 yuan, from 2004 to 2007 and then compile special funds 1800000000 yuan to Peking University. This calculation, each year to the north of the country is the appropriation of 2450000000 yuan, and all of its students total more than 16000 people, average 150000 yuan. Do not know if this is not true.
I do not oppose the university fees and even high fees, but the account is clear, to give the poor students scholarship system set out again received no later. Otherwise, only nine cattle to pull a hair like doing, no one will promise. If the high tuition fees charged to fairly allocated to the poor children to study, we say this for the benefit of both the social and the poor, is fair; if only to be, we say that such acts as the highwayman and rob. A qualified economists should not be reduced to defend the highwayman unbearable point. Okay, just as professor Zhang Weiying said, now the university teachers and students have international. Slowly, there will be more and more international schools pay our excellent poor children to school. Xue Yong in the America there encouraging everyone can read: don't go to Peking University Tsinghua University in Hongkong.
