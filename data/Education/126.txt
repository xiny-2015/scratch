American scientists with single wall carbon nanotubes and created a worthy and spider silk strong as (P) beautiful fiber. This kind of fiber, the structure is thinner than a hair, but also mechanical and electrical properties of significant.
This is the first large-scale use of carbon nanotube fibers.
Application of the future may include nano conductive performance is far better than the copper production line, and the fiber strength than aramid fibers. Aramid fiber is a man-made fibre made bulletproof vest.
A mooring nanotube production than steel cable strength is much larger, but much lighter weight. With this product, perhaps even create a science fiction writer Arthur Clark's "space elevator", with a fixed rope hundreds of miles of astronauts into orbit.
The study of the John Fisher of the University of Pennsylvania said: "in the research of carbon nanotubes process is relatively short, the ultimate goal is one of the nanotube fibers have made the use value. It uses almost inexhaustible, copper production from alternative, super strength fibers into the cable production 'space elevator'."
Fisher said, this kind of fiber has the mechanical and electrical properties, but they do not have the same thermal performance and ordinary nanotubes. He said: "even after several years of further research and improvement, we can see this kind of fiber has been applied."
