Authoritative personage points out: "college entrance examination proposition to make the old way to review test not good!" What is the old way? The old way is "with the basic knowledge as the center of the mechanical memory, mechanical imitation and Mechanical Practice (the sea tactical)". And the new approach is to "solve the problem of mathematical thought" as the center of the inquiry learning, the learning method is inductive: "practice of inquiry learning and problem solving -- -- Reflection and summary". A new way is our pro forma scientific compass, main countermeasures scientifically for is to hold "mathematical thinking" this center pegged to the following objectives:
1 peg optimization based: the construction of fewer but better, the best use of the "knowledge based systems", the fundamental knowledge of skilled and systematic. This and the traditional "lay the foundation" be totally different, we emphasize the use of mathematical thought optimization foundation, improve the level of thinking, rather than mechanically foundation. Students should check the first round of the review whether to do the "optimization based".
2 peg to the comprehensive training, popular application and search for new questions: the second round of the review should be "comprehensive training", of which there are two topics:
(1) the major knowledge integrated projects (knowledge network intersection); (2) special mathematical thought and method.
The two topics should be combined, the summary and abstract mathematical thinking, construct mathematical thought of "system", the problem solving strategies and methods of explicit, systematic. At the same time with the method of mathematics thought inquiry application problem and new problem.
3 peg to the logical expression: to learn mathematics communication, reach the language conversion, logical expression simplification.
