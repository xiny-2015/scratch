UN canard MOITI - e ", meaning" to half-sell a
Duck". The ducks may not certainly half sell half sell also is not to sell, obviously tease, to deceive buyers. With the passage of time, the French and the vendre UN canard,
MOITI (half sell duck) is simplified as bailleur de canards (sell duck), means "lying", and canard also evolved into a "rumor".
