&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; China has successfully developed the first robot can interact
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; China's most advanced humanoid robot painting portrait
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; China's newly developed two models of humanoid robot appearance
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; by the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of automation of the newly developed two humanoid robot, the afternoon of the nine day held in Beijing Olympic Park, the new China Science and Technology Museum foundation stone laying ceremony to meet with the public.
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; these two model of humanoid robot are China's first expression robot "Maria Tung" and China's first humanoid portrait robot "Becky", the former can interact, the latter can live painting, represents the highest level of humanoid robot developed at present in china.
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; cartoon shaped "Maria Tung" is an expression of master of performance, the face of the installation has more than ten micro servo motor, motion changes can be driven to make different facial features and different rate; head mounted two servo motor can drive the head left and right rotation and head, to supplement and strengthen facial expression. For each particular dialogue situations or on different occasions, in the body under the control of the computer, "Maria Tung" can make dozens or even hundreds of different facial expression changes, including a variety of different smile, laugh, different kinds of anger, anger, surprise, and thinking, regret, triumphant, listless and many funny weird expression. With voice recognition technology, abundant expression of the "Maria Tung" can dialogue with people, and a handshake, greeting gestures.
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; space artist known as "Becky" comprehensive use of cutting-edge technology of computer vision, face recognition, high precision motion control. The eye is a digital camera, the hand is a high technology content simulation arm, an advanced computer is its brain. It is a portrait, from the first digital camera in the image feature extraction, and then transformed into movement commands, hand control of machines on the drawing board to draw a portrait.
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; "Becky" can also like China ancient mythical magic brush, immediately draw the panda, monkey, kangaroo, dinosaurs, lions and other various animal according to the requirements, and on the spot for any portrait, the audience just sitting opposite to it to make it look eyes, a few minutes it will be able to draw a picture of the audience's portrait sketch.
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; the researchers say the two robots are China domestic initiative, in the field of some key technical characteristic, and can be widely used in science museums, shopping malls, toys and other fields, and has a broad market prospect.
