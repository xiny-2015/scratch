Although previously on the Shenhua will introduce third foreign aid statement has also been can be heard without end, but in fact, the problem of funds on the third foreign aid has not carried out down, but yesterday, according to people familiar with the matter said: "Shenhua now is a bit anxious, the introduction of the third foreign aid things already mentioned schedule up, this time the fund problems have been out."
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
In such a case, there have been media reports: after Martinez joined Omiya Ardija, did not fully show their true strength, cause he gradually by coach Miura Jun abandoned. At the same time, Japan's life also let Martin feel very depressed, Honduras people feel very not used to life in japan. Dual embarrassment on the field, the field under lets Martin feel very uncomfortable, so in the middle of April, Martin and his Broker's Firm of Japan proposed to the club. After serious negotiations between the parties, finally in April 30th to determine the formal surrender. Omiya Ardija club paid Martin's salary until May 31st, and in April 30th Martin retreat team, both who also do not have to pay liquidated damages.

Yesterday afternoon, Shenhua in Cambridge base after the end of the training, the Shenhua vice president Dai Chunhua said clearly: "Shenhua has been considering the introduction of the problem, the third foreign aid to be sure, the location should be in midfield, and the task is to attack organizer."
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
In this way, Shenhua has indeed in the beginning of the search for the third foreign aid, but not Martin seems to be not so clear. President Dai said: "we heard that the Japanese Club Omiya Ardija and Martinez, the two sides have to terminate the contract relationship. But not many others know, reasons for the contact of the contract, and his current state, we are not very clear. And once to the introduction of his words, Is it right? Procedures are complex, now is not very clear." It is reported, Martinez is currently a temporary stay in Japan, Japan's Broker's Firm are looking to participate in, Korea League chances for him.
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
Although Martin himself seems willing to go back to China again, but in fact, from the positioning president Dai "playmaker", Martin seems to be some far fetched, but the forward line and no one will help Shenhua against opponents of the gate of Shenhua, why don't you solve the problem into a ball in the League? This put the total time in the interpretation of the "midfielder", specifically refers to: "the midfielder task is also to be involved in the attack" this, in fact, cooperation between Martin and the Shenhua team, and the past him to Chinese life has been accustomed to these terms, he really is the Shenhua at present more the right candidate.
