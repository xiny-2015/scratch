    Taiwan cloth missile threat in Minjiang Estuary
    In May 6th, the Taiwan news station exclusive disclosure said, Taiwan's military is only about 60 km away from the mainland of Dongyin Island configuration "Xiongfeng type two" anti-ship missile, this island configuration anti-ship missile Taiwan's military for the first time in Taiwan's northernmost. Analysts believe the move extremely provocative, Taiwan army.   
    Taiwan's ETTV Taiwan May 6th exclusively revealed, "defense ministry", "naval command" has been officially decided: at a distance of only 60 km, Taiwan's northernmost island -- Dongyin Island allocation range of up to 150 km of coast launched "Xiongfeng type two" anti-ship missile. Once the deployment is completed, the Taiwan armed forces can effectively curb the mainland Minjiang mouth, ownership of sea of military superiority.
    Taiwan military officials said said, deployed in the East lead "treasures" type two "missile, a deterrent effect on the liberation army from the north to the East Sea fleet".

    In fact, the Taiwan military in Dongyin island on the deployment of missile is not a fresh thing, two years ago, the British "Jane's Defence Weekly" reports, Taiwan forces in Dongyin island on the construction of the large missile and radar bases, in order to "curb" across the Taiwan Strait, the naval and air attack.
    The Taiwan military officials have said: "east bring Island deployment 'Tiangong' missile, attack surface can be covered all the main airport mainland coast." "Tiangong" missile into position to deploy or mobile deployment. East island terrain trait, "Tiangong" missile should be based on the deployment of positions, and with the vertical launch as a combat readiness. In addition, Dongyin Island deployment as low altitude defense America "stinger" missile. Therefore, the comment thinks, in Taiwan in the Ma Zujian missile and radar bases, the purpose is to maneuver ability limit mainland naval and air in the northern end of the Strait of Taiwan.
    Two types of air defense missiles have been deployed two years ago, now add "Xiongfeng" type two missile, small East Island deployed three Taiwan in the core of the missile group.
    The authorities in Taiwan to achieve their "use force to resist reunification" of the plot, in recent years has been to strengthen the golden gate, Ma Zu, Wu Qiu He Dong cited four Island military force, attempted to Kinmen and Matsu Island into two Taiwan army for the implementation of the first defense line of defensive warfare. In fact, this line of defense, can only give yourself up. Tungyin island where the Matsu islands off the coast of Fujian recently only 16 kilometers, in the mainland under the eyelids -- whether to deploy on the islands of the Taiwan military firepower has many strong, saturation bombardment are not help resist the long-range artillery. "".
    Taiwan Army Ammunition Depot has about 300, from the distribution point of view, not only the quantity is not much, but is too concentrated, easy to destroy. The Taiwan military high-level evaluation said, if the Taiwan Strait war, more than half of Taiwan Army Arsenal may be destroyed. The island became a burgeoning island.

    Taiwan army want to anger the mainland?
    Military deployment of Taiwan's military and authorities in Dongyin Island actually have an ulterior motive.
    The heating on the current China US relations, and the government of Bush Chen Shuibian growing dissatisfaction. In this case, the Taiwan authorities want to through active provocation to rile China, response, and then change America support for Taiwan, in order to achieve the purpose of separation of Sino US relations.
    At the same time, the deployment of the "Han Kuang exercise, repair" exposed weaknesses. In May 4th, Taiwan's "defense ministry" published "Han Kuang No. 22" exercise results, computer rulings show, in the unmanned aircraft, enemy air and missile head wave attack, army battle combat capability is still preserved, but the position of the missile, radar station, airport and other fixed facilities, under the early warning and anti missile capability shortage will seriously damaged force, can barely saved. The Taiwan military is not the first singing their missile and anti missile ability is insufficient, the fundamental purpose of Taiwan army, is actually for outside of their missile development, strengthen the military support.
