    The State Council American published on the 28 annual global anti-terrorism situation report said, because USA launched the war on terror, "base" organization was greatly weakened, the global anti-terrorism cooperation to strengthen gradually, the world becomes more secure.
    The report says, although "the number one terrorist threat the base" the organization is still America and its allies faced, but in USA hit, the organization has been greatly weakened, its leadership has lost the ability to the unity of command. The report thinks, the world becomes another reason more secure is to strengthen global cooperation against terrorism.
    The report said, according to the statistics, last year the global total of 1.1 000 terrorist attack, killing about 14600 people, and the previous year's figures for 3129. But the report said that last year's figures are the United States adopted more broadly defined terrorist attacks to statistics, not comparable with the previous year's figures so.
    The report said that in the event of the world last year's terrorist attacks in Iraq accounted for 30%; in terror victims, death in Iraq accounted for 55%. But the report says that, since the United States efforts, as the main battlefield of the global fight against terrorism in Iraq and not become a terrorist haven. The report also acknowledged that the war on terror will be a long struggle, and full of ups and downs.
    The State Department report will continue to Iran, Sultan, Libya, Syria, Cuba and North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism, and regards Iran as "the most active supporters of terrorism," most makes us worried.
