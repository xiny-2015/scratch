    [USA "HangYu daily" reported in April 21, 2006] America mechanism two consultants will next week issued a report, the report pointed out that American army very fruitful for the maintenance and protection of the work force in the process of transformation, but there are also problems. According to a statement Lexington Research Institute chief operating officer Thompson released in April 21st said, Lexington research center and do American progress report will also put forward the deficiencies in the war in Iraq in terms of weapons and equipment exist, especially in the force protection, information fusion and communication.
    He is especially put forward improved the shortage of Army helicopter equipment. In Afghanistan and Iraq lost more than 100 helicopters, USA army is developing an advanced missile warning systems, the system will be deployed in 2009. Thompson points out, the army past on aircraft survivability protection equipment investment is not enough, so the use of helicopters in Iraq cannot reliably detect incoming missile. In the late summer of this year, all in the Iraqi helicopter will carry a AAR-57 tip common missile warning system. But although the system can detect the missile, the pilot can only use the release of flash bomb and other means of interference on the missile, effect of this method for the new type of heat seeking missiles is not too ideal. The sensor model to distinguish flash missile and aircraft engine, so can still pose a threat to aircraft. Thompson points out, the army should be installed using a low energy laser infrared countermeasures system with interference missile sensor, so they are unable to find the target. American air force already has such system has been installed in the C-17 and C-130 transport plane. (Huang Peishen The whole Hongshan)
