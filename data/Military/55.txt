    In new network on 8 May, by the Shenyang military region developed "theater meteorological support data simulation system", recently passed the technical appraisal of the headquarters of the organization.
    The Liberation Army Daily reports, the system will be the application of virtual simulation technology in the field of meteorological safeguard, successfully simulation of weather, terrain simulation, remote sensing image and numerical weather prediction and other organic combination, to build the digital battlefield model, provides a scientific platform for commander to the correct use of the atmospheric environment draw on the advantages and avoid disadvantages.
    In the Shenyang Military Region Command, an online confrontation training is underway in the battle, the "Red Army" tanks and armored vehicles, first to "the blues" position to launch a raid, poses a great threat to the "blue" line of defense. In combat, abrupt change of weather, thunder and lightning, high winds and torrential rain, the sudden bad weather delayed the "Red Army" to attack. "The blues" to seize this opportunity, and the "Red Army" to fight, both sides played inextricably...... The weather phenomenon so lifelike, is the use of the "theater of meteorological safeguard data out of the virtual simulation system".
    According to experts, the use of virtual simulation and visualization technology, rigorous scientific and visual to the sun and the moon and the stars, atmospheric environment, terrain simulation, so that the officers remain within doors can be personally on the scene like in meteorological conditions under the command of virtual organization of military action, military training is more close to the practical requirements.
