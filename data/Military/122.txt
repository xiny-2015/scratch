    In new network on 29 April, according to the West China Metropolis Daily reported, on the morning of 28, roar broke the quiet over the Chengdu Wenjiang airport. 'new fighter developed by China, with independent intellectual property rights of the first flight ceremony was held here. Yesterday all state first flight after the aircraft will enter mass production stage.
    It is understood that the JF-17 fighter is aimed at the low market, not only win by technology, but by the right price to win the market. Analysis of the industry, in twenty-first Century, many developing countries equipped MIG -19, MIG -21 and F-5 light fighter must update, this is a relatively large aircraft market. More analysts pointed out that at present the JF-17 will face several main rival F-16, Jacques 130, South Korea's T50 etc..
    The first is the F-16 fighter, it is heavier than Xiaolong one level, therefore, electronic equipment, external capacity and range performance has clear advantage. But because the JF-17 is a new production of the aircraft, and the aircraft is relatively small, the use and the maintenance cost is low, its advantage is very obvious. Jacques, 130, South Korea's T50 and other new generation advanced trainer has good maneuvering performance and certain land attack capability, but the plane than Xiaolong one size too small, weapons, with a combat radius of missile flight etc. will be affected, so the small stature, operational performance, 'the obvious advantages.
    As Chinese developed, with completely independent intellectual property rights of the JF-17, the motor performance, excellent perfect electronic equipment and weapons systems, and have good performance of air combat and ground attack capability has become the new fighter with strong international competition ability. Forecast concerned, the JF-17 export prospects worth looking forward to. (Jian Wenmin Tang Minmin)
