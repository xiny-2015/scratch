    BAE systems in the UK have been awarded Raytheon a $70000000 contract for FCS car R & D hard kill active protection system. The project is a US Army FCS manned ground vehicles to avoid being hit by a part of the project. The contract period of three stages, the initial stage will cost $10000000.
    Allegedly, BAE systems, Raytheon earlier this month has been selected as the FCS active protection system developers. This option would use Raytheon sensors, fire control and interception technology, to speed up the development of active protection system, and the active protection system is integrated into the FCS manned ground vehicles, and prolongs the service life of active vehicle. The company is responsible for the BAE system by Raytheon hard kill active protection system and soft killing, camouflage, aided decision-making software integration, comprehensive protection system and integrated in the manned ground vehicle.
    Active protection system is to avoid being hit the full spectrum of key protection system component, the full spectrum protection system to protect the FCS manned ground vehicles and soldiers from harm. With the sensor technology and precision against the ammunition to replace heavy armor, the new system can meet the need of car viability of FCS. In addition, the soft killing electronic countermeasures including interference device and decoy device, hard kill countermeasure ammunition is layered to avoid being hit a part of components, can provide a full spectrum of survival ability, can withstand the Rockets, antitank guided missile, high explosive anti tank missile, top Attack Munitions and consists of tank firing kinetic energy projectile.
