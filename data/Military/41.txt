    NATO research task group in April 8, 2006 held a conference in Bonn, issued a series of UGV potential index. This will contribute to the production of general UGV in 2008.
    The group aims to build unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) general index. Implementation of surveillance and reconnaissance tasks UGV will require the identification friend or foe sensor, and can provide information and designated by NBC contamination routes, the UGV is also available with someone and other unmanned vehicle communication; implementation of clearing mines tasks UGV must be integrated tactical and post conflict processing function, which rely on this feature to detect and mark anti infantry and anti tank mines, the UGV must have the independent mode, which can receive radio messages from the remote operation, implementation of the escort mission; the UGV can follow the road vehicles, with automatic charging and uninstall function; the implementation of inspection and security tasks before the UGV alert and remember any nearby vehicles and personnel, need to have the protection of explosives and identify explosives function; as the car carrying foot soldiers and equipment, UGV should be able to delivZr supplies and wounded soldiers in all terrain, and can work continuously for 48 hours, weight less than 100 kg, the UGV also requires communication connection, self-defense and storage of all contact with the car contact information. Although the current technology can not meet all the requirements, but all UGV must have the mobility, wireless communication, security and multipoint communication function, can automatically follow the road, the maximum speed of 50 km / h..
    In addition, the current sensor in obstacle avoidance and dredging, mine detection, mine clearance and NBC perception insufficiency, allegedly sensor in obstacle avoidance and dredge deficiency to 2008 can only solve part of the problem. According to the current pace of development, by 2008 will not solve the navigation problems.
    NATO research task group called for the project of multi robot in Europe also developed a similar Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, to ensure that the robot autonomous collaboration and distinguish the event priority. NATO research task group has established a consists of users, industry representatives and researchers study found the core team, and will be in 2006 second quarter report.
