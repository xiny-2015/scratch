    In new network on 2 May, according to the PLA Daily reported, Chinese Air Force units to flight safety new concept of the development of the whole assembly, Shenzhen fine training activities, in the complex electromagnetic environment confrontation training, new aircraft aerial refueling training system, heterogeneous remote cooperative combat exercises such as targeted training has made new breakthroughs, the coordinated development of quality and safety of flight training.
    Flight safety is an important factor to restrict the growth of the air force. Early last year, the Party committee at the air force on the base of summarizing the experiences, research and establish a new concept of the flight safety, its purpose is not to sacrifice the fighting capacity of negative security, to improve the fighting capacity as the starting point and the foothold of flight safety, the establishment of subordinate to and in the service of the fighting capacity of growing security mechanism. After more than a year of practice, the air force military training presents a series of great changes.
    -- scientific planning, scientific organization, scientific guidance, around the battle force grasping safety ideas win support among the people. The air force to the pilot as the main body, take the quality as the foundation, taking regulations as a guarantee, to technological innovation as the driving force, to overcome the negative safety and reckless acts two wrong tendencies. In the face of flight safety pressure, the air force training task does not reduce, the difficulty is not reduced by improving the fighting capacity, actively to ensure flight safety.
    -- air land combat aircraft, confrontation, "red blue" confrontation, targeted training deepening. The air force respectively according to their operational tasks, all expanded tactical training. A flight trial base to carry out the high strength, high difficulty "red blue" relying on Air Force combat training, effectively enhance the tactical awareness of forces, promoting tactics innovation.
    -- complex weather conditions, complex electromagnetic environment, complex tactical background, the actual combat drills the unprecedented strengthening. All air force have complex electromagnetic environment, complex tactical background into tactical training, often in complex weather conditions and strange airspace organization tactics study and training, tactical training is more close to the actual requirements, the number of aviation division formed to participate in live fire training of the air force historical high record.
    -- new aircraft, new task, new methods, new equipment training full speed. Air force new machine forces in military exercises significant military activity as a practice platform, key and difficult to crack control of generating combat capabilities improve, last year the successful completion of the "peace mission major task -2005" China Russia joint military exercises and "North sword -2005" military exercises.
