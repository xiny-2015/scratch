    According to the research of the Soviet military that, when the attacking side missile quantity exceeding the target carrier fleet anti missile defense when processing limit, the aircraft carrier battle group defense will be taken. According to this theory, the former Soviet Union military invention against aircraft carrier "saturation attack tactics".
    Simulation exercises against my secret plans to increase military coastal targets -- the four U.S. aircraft carrier group shock China
    The Chinese President Hu Jintao and U.S. President Barack Bush met with a friendly atmosphere, "Washington Times" recently revealed that, the U. S. Department of defense is Asia Pacific area cantonment heavily, re adjust the carrier battle group, the increased deployment of nuclear submarines, regularly sent bombers to drill in East Asia area, speed up the troops mobilize the speed to increase the deterrent to China and the strength of North korea. This plan will be fully completed in the next three to five years.
    The United States anti University May drill "Strait contingencies"
    According to the Japanese public television (NHK) reported in April 21st, the defense department and relevant departments USA program at National Defense University in May 22nd, according to the Taiwan Strait "an emergency" measures "empty talk" -- held the paper deduce pure, it will be two years of National Defense University of the United States second times held a similar exercise.
    Words USA National Defense University concerned report quoted, responsible for research on military strategy of the National Defense University will set the Defense Department, the State Council and the central intelligence agency policy held responsible for this exercise.
    The National Defense University in the United States is not the first held similar exercises. In July 12, 2004, the National Defense University held a code named "dragon roar" crisis imaginary simulation exercise, exercise is also growing tensions across the Taiwan Strait area "based on". Secretary of defense Rumsfeld office, The Pentagon joint staff office, the US Pacific Command, the White House National Security Committee, the National Intelligence Council, the State Council, the Ministry of Commerce officials, America Congress 14 members participated in the exercise. Specific programs of "dragon roar" exercises of the genus "top secret", but USA National Defense University officials are on privately said, the exercise is one of the Secretary of defense Rumsfeld "series of exercises ordered", its importance is ranked ninth! National Defense University spokesman David Thomas is openly said, although the specific content of the exercise and "the experience gained and lessons" cannot be disclosed at all, but this simulation exercise means that the simulation content "is very likely to become a reality". "Long Xiao" exercise what is intended? Thomas openly said, "the purpose of the exercise is to understand the United States for the restoration of stability across the Taiwan Straits and can obtain all the policy choice and the relevant consequences, and can avoid the occurrence of a nuclear confrontation with china".
    And for second similar exercises to be held in May 22nd, America National Defense University emphasis on the one hand, this exercise and "Long Xiao" the same "is not an actual plan", the same is not open to the public, but analysts think, this reflects USA defense and other relevant agencies will be based on the latest information on both sides of the Taiwan Strait the examination of effective countermeasures, Taiwan Strait crisis; on the other hand, in recent times the U.S. military simulation exercise results let us feel very uncomfortable. In one exercise, U.S. forces planned by F - 22 and the "Joint Strike Fighter such as" the most advanced stealth fighter night Liberation Army Air and missile positions, sent the aircraft carrier battle group targets, coastal China, America army in five days will be a division of the troop transport on the front, the Marines aboard can vertical landing V 22 rotor aircraft behind enemy lines. But in the course of the exercise, American three aircraft carriers in the people's Liberation Army anti-ship missile threats, away from the coast, the ship all 250 aircraft are useless. American can use it only B - 2 stealth bombers and cruise missiles, but they are the outcome of the war is difficult to play a decisive role.
    According to the Convention, the Taiwan Strait Crisis simulation exercises by the U.S. Pacific Command of the U. S. Army Combat complete simulation centre or National Defense University. Before the drill, American hand using spy satellites, reconnaissance aircraft, spy ship to collect specific location in mainland China forces in communication signals, near the Taiwan Strait fighter redeployment, missile position; on the other hand, the requirements of Taiwan area, the military departments to provide the army with the number, weapon parameters and false target position.
    Sources said that in the previous exercise, the army has two big worry. One is the fear of the Taiwan military morale, another concern is the allies in wartime attitude. The US military believes, the war in Korea and Japan is very difficult to take in the danger of war to the U.S. military or naval port open air base. If the Allies did not support, American supply lines will be completely exposed in the PLA submarine force fire. The U. S. Pacific Command in observation "Han Kuang exercise"

    At the same time, Taiwan area senior military said on April 22nd, "Han Kuang No. 22" computer simulation exercise stage was officially launched on April 24th, this phase will deduce the 2008 "homeland defense", the mainland people's Liberation Army will soon scored the island, and will launch more than 10 wave of missile attack and more than 20 waves of air attacks, Taiwan to verify operations ability of ground lost air superiority condition.
    Taiwan's "regulars", repeatedly led a delegation to observe the "Han Kuang exercise the U. S. Pacific Command, Admiral Blair has been quietly arrival rate advisory group. However, because it does not want to influence the two heads of state summit atmosphere and confidential consideration, Blair advisers after Taiwan rejected all media interview, directly into the exercise headquarters barracks, does not allow any consultant leave place half a step, more not unauthorized communication with the outside world.
    However, Blair's Advisory Group has started this year the "Han Kuang No. 22" exercise substantial proposals to the Taiwan military, such as strong demand the Taiwan military exercise "should be combined with the actual". In the year before the "Han Kuang No. 20" exercise for the first time by 24 hours of uninterrupted time, many staff complain too tired, therefore, last year the "Han Kuang No. 21" exercises into 8 hours a day, the results of Blair's U.S. military advisory group have strong opinions, the more they shocked, unexpectedly also found in people take a nap, therefore, he strongly recommended this restored 24 hours uninterrupted exercise, Taiwan Army therefore restored 24 hours three class took turns for the practice, while the "chief of staff" is for the five and a half days in Heng Mountain command center, until the end of the exercise.
    In addition, the exercise to last year "war emergency", Taiwan in accordance with the provisions of a meeting to discuss countermeasures, but American advisers think combat against the clock, the meeting time is too long, this situation may have been compromised, exercises should be close to the actual combat. Therefore, Maag requirements, this year's exercise a certain "really play", the past has two pre exercise warm-up, formal exercises in fact is "according to script" exercise third times; therefore, the U.S. military advice Taiwan army should not be too dependent on a predetermined plan, also don't preview, in this kind of situation, this year the preview is changed into system test and staff ", let the novice familiar with the computer system, plays the Red Army station" National Defense University "instructors also no early exposure to attack Taiwan tactical pla.

    American Asia Pacific Tun heavily deterrence Chinese Korea plans to formally approved
    Bigger plan and simulation exercises and matching guidance Taiwan Army military exercises in fact has been released, it is America government quietly approved The Pentagon "deterrence, North Korea Asia Pacific Tun heavily China plan", this plan includes the following four aspects:
    Rearrange the carrier group, additional nuclear submarines. The formal approval of the Asia Pacific military adjustment programs focus on naval armaments. The Navy will be reforming the deployment of aircraft carrier battle group, in order to let the ability to mobilize doubled. If the deployment is completed, the U.S. military will at the same time to the Asian deployed 4 aircraft carrier battle groups, more than in the past can only arouse the two aircraft carriers. Synchronized with the news is, according to the Agence France-Presse reports, Japanese Yokosuka City governor said in April 17th, Yokosuka can accept USA nuclear powered aircraft carrier battle group, allowing the "George Washington" in 2008 formally entered Yokosuka port: "although there may be some nuclear incident safety protective measures to consultations, but the nuclear aircraft carrier safety that American 17 page completely touched me, we should be able to accept American nuclear aircraft carrier." In addition, ballistic missile submarines also played a key role in. The Department of defense is of USA dispatched the first special action group to japan. And the Marine Corps assault troops are also ready to counterattack by nuclear weapons and biological weapons attacks. Minister of naval operations admiral Mullen said, more and more attention Chinese. Facing the China challenge, in addition to the increase in a Navy aircraft carrier battle group, more will be 60% Submarine Force stationed in the Asia Pacific region. He says to the reporter: "I certainly hope to achieve peace and stability and security, but China recently increased military are doubtful: 'why is it so soon?' So put a deterrent posture is very important."
    Two more bombers were deployed in Guam. In the approved plan, located in the West Pacific Guam is key, because strategic bombers stationed in the whole of Asia can fly to any target within 3 hours. America is spending $5000000000 to improve the facilities in Guam, to supply more ships, submarines and aircraft parking. American a Marine Corps generals revealed, Guam deployment can strengthen the prevention "from missile attack Chinese or North korea".
    The three is currently designed to intercept long-range missile defense system in North Korea a few years will be updated, including assisting in the development of Japan's missile defense system.
    Four is to strengthen the military exercises in China. USA military would strengthen the training of speaking Chinese officials. In addition, in the "hedging strategy in Asia", held a military exercise is more important. U. S. aircraft carrier in the Pacific launched this summer will exercise the biggest in recent decades, will be dispatched 3 aircraft carrier battle groups. And the annual military exercises as 100 times seventh fleet will increase the number of exercises, and with the India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, South Korea and Japan joint exercises.

    At the same time, recently, in Taiwan Bush expression problems pointed out, America no change of stance on Taiwan, "we do not support Taiwan independence". He reiterated the support of "a Chinese" policy and the three Sino US joint communiques, said don't want Taiwan to change the status quo, also do not want Taiwan the impact of Sino US relations.
    The numbers of Bush government plans to display quite low-key. According to "Washington Times" report, this program is managed by the defense minister Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick, plan as a whole, and in a few months ago has been the approval of the president of the Bush secret. The message says, Bush president to eliminate China concerns, but also through the relevant channels to China are described.
    Said America officials privately, in the Asia Pacific region is to "prevent the deployment of heavily China become a hostile forces, and when a conflict occurs, quickly using pre deployment military balance in Asia Chinese". However, the official also admitted that, most military action "to avoid stimulation China", covert action will try to downplay the intention to Chinese as target, emphasize the changes American military action of globalization. America other low-key military activities including large-scale exercise, increased military allies, strengthen exercise and ally, to send special forces to Asia, requirements for military personnel to learn Chinese etc..
