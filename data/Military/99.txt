    The Taiwan authorities regardless of fisherman, not intrusive "territorial waters" of the Japanese Self Defense Force ships "calling", only know that military intelligence spying on the continent, it "is really surprising".

    Long term since, the Taiwan authorities to Japan in the disputed waters activity "swallow insult and humiliation silently, constantly concessions", and on the mainland ships perform normal scientific research task in the Taiwan Strait is blame.
    According to Taiwan "Chinese times" reported, Taiwan Navy says, in recent years, sends many hydrographic ships entered waters around Taiwan, "Taiwan military information collection, detection of the Strait of Taiwan hydrological data", "master, once the Taiwan Strait hydrological data enough, quite unfavorable to Taiwan". Therefore, taiwan taiwan navy navy has assigned only hydrographic ship "philosophical" related hydrological detection, "argued with the mainland". It is understood, this ship has also repeatedly secretly went to the East China Sea of hydrologic data collection.
    "Optimistic" as AGS-1601 in Taiwan Army Navy number, was purchased from Italy, arrive in Kaohsiung in September 9, 1995, 16 in the Navy Zuoying port into the army. The ship a total length of 93 meters, 15.5 meters wide, with a displacement of 3200 tons, speed of 15.5 knots per hour. "Optimistic" equipped with many sophisticated detection instrument, such as a dual band unique Taiwan Navy ships in the differential global positioning system (DGPS), high accuracy, positioning error in the CM level. At the same time, the current detector detects ADCP Doppler 700 meters deep ocean currents and can monitor the underwater sound UT-2000 underwater monitoring system and other advanced equipment of EM-1000 submarine topography mapping system and 5 underwater positioning system, also equipped with. In addition, there are a number of laboratories, can collect 32000000 data every day, multi channel seabed terrain mapping system, precision drawing the maximum depth of 10000 meters deep seabed topography, for anti submarine and anti mine blockade has a key role in combat.
    The ship's business although Taiwan "by marine survey" supervision, but still belong to the marine jurisdiction, logistic support ships of the 142 fleet of membership. Because the marine surveying information with strong colors, in order to reduce the sensitivity, "philosophical" using similar merchant coating, bow did not paint Shanghai ships necessary frigate and in English ship name instead of. In addition to the general driving personnel, there are some major hydrographic personnel responsible for hydrographic service, commander wearing the rank of major.
    According to the Taiwan Navy who privately revealed that the Taiwan military to send a "philosophical" spy, East China Sea, surface is a collection of hydrological data, is actually the trends of spying on the continental Navy and coastal troops. The monitoring system of underwater equipments, can detect submarine activity, on Taiwan Navy, military intelligence collection of great help. Taiwan Navy top bluntly pointed out that the ship "is more important than contained many missile artillery warship, Taiwan army which can increase the odds and opportunities of antisubmarine system sea".
    To station naval practice, many of the Taiwan military experts and people are very dissatisfied, they said that the Taiwan authorities regardless of fisherman, not intrusive "territorial waters" of the Japanese Self Defense Force ships "calling", only know that military intelligence spying on the mainland, this "is really strange".
