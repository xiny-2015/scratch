In new network on 28 April, according to the national defense science and Industry Committee news propaganda center news, April 24th, L15 (Lie Ying) with only one month machine of higher education, the successful completion of the work of all flight a total of 9 sorties flying the first stage, the development of aircraft system works normally, Lie Ying's work and achieved initial results.
The first flight phase of the flight test, L15 (Lie Ying) advanced training aircraft flight control, avionics, machinery, gear subsystems has been verified preliminarily, Lie Ying's excellent performance and flying qualities are emerging skill. It is reported, the Falcon take-off requirements landing performance is better than the technical indicators, high angle of attack and low speed glide trajectory is very stable, such as angle of attack landing graceful posture, ground speed to fly out of 200km/h following good grades; in addition, the small aircraft speed flying flying quality also won the praise of the chief test pilot.
Evaluation of the Falcon's test pilot, and the feeling of flight control plane table ground simulation is very similar to fly a plane, and some also superior ground simulation, maneuvering and former trainer also compared, desired manipulation and effort is much smaller, control response tracking is good, is a very good flying aircraft.
At present, the Hongdu group company is in nervous and orderly ground to embark on the next stage of adjustment test preparation. (Yang Zhangyue Deng Yonghong)
