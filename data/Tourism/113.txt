Recently, relevant departments to invest about 6000000 yuan, in Shanxi Province, Zuoquan county library ma Tian Yuan "the headquarters of the Eight Route Army" the former site of the former, most probably it did not actually happen to build an area more than 1 square meters of the "headquarters of the Eight Route Army Plaza", make the national key cultural relics protection units like change (according to the new China net news). It was questioned.
The development of the red tourism resources by the local red, this is a new item of tourism in recent years. Red tourism has its own particularity, the main interest of visitors to this a visit is to pay tribute to revolutionary relics, circular thinking, the thinking of new concept, to enlighten the mind, the life course correction. Therefore, the red spots must keep original, can make the person produces the feeling of be personally on the scene, so that visitors have the education of revolutionary tradition and patriotism education.
However, now the red tourism in some places there have been some strange phenomenon: some place to be busy at putting up installations are unrealistic, blind development, real historical relic was altered to lose one's beyond recognition; some guides for visitors to Bo Le, a red resources talk, and even fabricated some unofficial history, customers, draw a forced analogy, confuse the public; some red spots in the worship driven, open all avenues of income, and even appeared staged striptease farce in the cemetery of martyrs; some guides for life history of things and the great feudal superstition pulled together, big speak great man's former home feng shui; some red spots should not fee charges, so that the "political significance and cultural significance of red tourism" hurt. All in all, there is a distortion of history, fool visitors too, hurt the red resources is ecru, contrary to the original intention of red tourism.
Red tourism is a non renewable resource, it is different from the development and operation of other products. In the introduction of tourism business philosophy at the same time, more should have political significance and social benefits in the first place, emphasize the seriousness of respecting the history of revolutionary relics, keep the original style, true reproduction of history, so as to give visitors to enlighten and inspire.
