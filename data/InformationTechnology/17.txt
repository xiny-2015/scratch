Xinhua news agency, NASA officials said recently, NASA has decided to set up a $2500000 Grand Prix, hoping in this way to elect the design scheme of the future vehicle landed on the moon.
A space conference vice director of NASA's DELL held in May 5th in the state of California said that NASA has selected the "X Award" fund management of the competition, NASA in addition to the prize money, will also be in the future moon landing award-winning application plan scheme.
The Grand Prix asked participants to design a prototype aircraft can fly, landing on the moon. "The X Prize Foundation said," it will be the competition is divided into two levels, in the face of the Earth Moon flight simulation. The first stage, the participating aircraft requirements to 50 meters high emission from the emission point on earth, hovering flight for 90 seconds, and in the distance the launch point landing the designated place 100 meters, the game first will get a $350000 bonus.
The second level of difficulty is much higher. Entry requirements from the launch aircraft launch to a height of 50 meters, hovering flight 180 seconds, and in the 100 meters outside the surface of the moon at a similar rough location precision landing. The winners of this competition to get a $1250000 bonus, the proposal is likely to be the space agency adopted, as a future moon landing aircraft prototype.
"X" Award Foundation for hosting the private spacecraft design Grand Prix and famous, famous space designer Bert Rutan spaceship "number one" in 2004 successfully flew into sub orbital, become the world's first private construction design of spacecraft, and has won a $10000000 "X awards".
