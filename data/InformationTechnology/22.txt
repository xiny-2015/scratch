&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; blog viewpoint: the paradox of sina micro version: advertising better, worse?
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; an analyst's point of view:
Chinese economy is growing fast, investors hope in the world's most populous market share, Sina reported first quarter earnings on Tuesday after the close. Since the February release of earnings, and an increase of three of sina analyst. In all tracking Sina analysts, five rating to "buy", eight people, two people of "holding" "sell".
Analysts expected quarterly earnings sina will remain basically unchanged, at around $45900000. Earnings per share will drop by 25%, to 15 cents per share. Released in the fourth quarter of last year of the financial report, Sina CEO Wang Yan used "challenges" to describe the company's situation, the company in 2005 fourth quarter and full year revenue fell, mainly due to the non advertising business downturn, the advertising revenue growth of more than 30%, has accounted for nearly half of the company's revenue.
People think that advertising portal is a high margin business, but Sina's gross margin in the past 18 months has been in decline, fell from 70.1% to 67.4%; in the revenue decline at the same time, operating costs have been rising, operating margins fell from 36.4% to 21.5%, net profit rate down from 31.9% to 22.3%.
Motley Fool stock advisor David Gardiner in 2005 November to begin recommend Sina, he said at the time: "Google fans like advertising revenue based model, because of the high profit margins. But the development of the Internet in China at this stage, I am glad to Sina maintains a wide range of income, I like Sina explores various income opportunities efforts."
However, sina is increasingly dependent on advertising, maybe Gardiner is now on the Sina feeling than before, especially the advertising revenue proportion increases did not improve gross margin. Even so, Gardiner recently told Sina comments, "prepared" for the occupation of the Chinese market for some of the most important areas, hope Sina tomorrow's news does let investors see the signs.
